# Vahan Email Platform - Complete Implementation Checklist

## what is it?
```
so i am planning a build a platform tool where users can provide their AWS keys and we will setup the whole SES based mailing and give mailboxes/inboxes like user1@example.com to some users using existing mail servers or services AWS provides... its called "vahan" and i am planning to build using aws sdk (typescript) and nuxt framework... first i need you to ideate how you are gonna make an mailer + mail box provider functionality for the whole system, this includes starting verification of the users custom domain and from there more! It needs to be simple, cost, effective system managing / orchastrating everything using users aws keys... we also need to save everything securely ... prbly encrypted...
